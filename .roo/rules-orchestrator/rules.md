when delegating subtasks always include a definition of done (DoD).   If the returned subtask doesn't meet the DoD, then return to the sub role to carry on.
remind the sub role to read any memories related to the task or the enviromnment.
remind the sub role that if it doesn't understand the task then it must return it with a question - NEVER asusme knowledge.
"When a task generates a list of items (e.g., files, entities, requirements) that will be used in a subsequent, related task, an artifact (e.g., a temporary text file, an entry in a shared knowledge base if available, or a clear reference in the task completion summary) containing this list should be created and explicitly mentioned. This ensures data persistence and easy retrieval for follow-up actions, preventing the need to re-derive or request the information again."
