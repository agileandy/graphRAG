# Debug Mode Rules

## Python Projects

When debugging Python projects, please be aware of and adhere to the guidelines outlined in the [Python Project Guidelines](./python_guidelines.md). This includes, but is not limited to:
- Understanding that `uv` is used for package management.
- Knowing that Python scripts are typically run with `uv run <filename.py>`.
