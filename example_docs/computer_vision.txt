            Computer Vision: Enabling Machines to See
            
            Computer vision is a field of artificial intelligence that trains computers to interpret and 
            understand the visual world. Using digital images from cameras and videos and deep learning 
            models, machines can accurately identify and classify objects and then react to what they "see."
            
            Computer vision works in three basic steps: acquiring an image, processing the image, and 
            understanding the image. Image acquisition can be as simple as retrieving a digital image from 
            a database or as complex as producing 3D images from multiple angles. Image processing involves 
            methods like noise reduction, contrast enhancement, and image sharpening to bring out features 
            of interest. Image understanding is where machine learning and deep learning algorithms come into 
            play, allowing the system to recognize patterns and make decisions.
            
            Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have revolutionized computer vision by automatically learning 
            hierarchical feature representations from raw image data. These networks consist of multiple layers, 
            including convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers, each serving a specific 
            purpose in the feature extraction and classification process.
            
            Applications of computer vision are vast and growing, including facial recognition, autonomous 
            vehicles, medical image analysis, surveillance, augmented reality, and quality control in manufacturing.
