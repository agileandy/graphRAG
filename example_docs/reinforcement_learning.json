  "text": "\n                Reinforcement Learning (RL) is an area of machine learning concerned with how intelligent agents \n                ought to take actions in an environment in order to maximize the notion of cumulative reward. \n                Reinforcement learning is one of three basic machine learning paradigms, alongside supervised \n                learning and unsupervised learning.\n                \n                Reinforcement learning differs from supervised learning in that labeled input/output pairs need \n                not be presented, and sub-optimal actions need not be explicitly corrected. Instead the focus is \n                on finding a balance between exploration (of uncharted territory) and exploitation (of current \n                knowledge).\n                \n                The environment is typically stated in the form of a Markov decision process (MDP), because many \n                reinforcement learning algorithms for this context utilize dynamic programming techniques. The \n                main difference between the classical dynamic programming methods and reinforcement learning \n                algorithms is that the latter do not assume knowledge of an exact mathematical model of the MDP \n                and they target large MDPs where exact methods become infeasible.\n                \n                Deep reinforcement learning combines deep learning with reinforcement learning. Deep neural networks \n                are used to approximate the value function, policy, or model of the environment. This approach has \n                led to significant achievements, such as defeating world champions in the game of Go and mastering \n                complex video games.\n                "
