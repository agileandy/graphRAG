            Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that provides systems the ability 
            to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. 
            Machine learning focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and 
            use it to learn for themselves.
            
            The process of learning begins with observations or data, such as examples, direct experience, 
            or instruction, in order to look for patterns in data and make better decisions in the future 
            based on the examples that we provide. The primary aim is to allow the computers to learn 
            automatically without human intervention or assistance and adjust actions accordingly.
            
            Supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning are the three main 
            categories of machine learning algorithms. Supervised learning uses labeled training data to 
            learn the mapping function from the input variables to the output variable. Unsupervised 
            learning, on the other hand, does not have labeled outputs, so its goal is to infer the 
            natural structure present within a set of data points. Reinforcement learning is a type of 
            machine learning where an agent learns to behave in an environment by performing actions and 
            seeing the results.
