    *   Implemented & Regular Review of Test Coverage Reports.
    *   Standardized Docker-based Test Environment Setup.
    *   Comprehensive Test Data Management & Versioning Strategy.

### Low Priority (Long-Term: 4+ Weeks)
*   **Core System & Architecture:**
    *   Detailed Production Deployment Topology Design
        *   Kubernetes/Orchestration Strategy
        *   Cloud Provider Specifics (if any)
        *   Advanced Production Networking
*   **Deployment:**
    *   Comprehensive Production Deployment Guide (beyond basic Docker Compose).
    *   Disaster Recovery & Business Continuity Plan.
*   **Database Design & Optimization:**
    *   Data Lifecycle Management Policies (Retention, Archival, Deletion).
*   **Dockerization:**
    *   Advanced Orchestration Configuration (e.g., Helm charts if using K8s).
*   **Security:**
    *   Dedicated Security Design Document
        *   Threat Models
        *   Production Security Measures per Component
        *   Data Encryption Key Management (Production)
        *   Incident Response Plan
    *   User Management & Access Control Design (System-wide, if applicable).
*   **Scalability & Performance:**
    *   Specific Performance Benchmarks Defined.
    *   Load Testing Plan.
    *   Defined Performance Targets (SLAs/SLOs) for Production.
*   **Monitoring & Logging:**
    *   Comprehensive Production Monitoring Strategy (Metrics, Dashboards).
    *   Centralized Logging Strategy for Production (Aggregation, Analysis).
    *   Alerting Strategy for Production Issues.
*   **LLM Interaction:**
    *   Advanced LLM Design (Fine-tuning, Provider Management, Cost Opt., Rate Limits).

## 2. Outstanding Test Cases

Based on the Test Plan Status Summary (`project/audit/test_plan_summary.md`).

### In-Progress (Aim to Complete Short-Term: 1-2 Weeks)
*   Edge case testing
*   Error handling scenarios

### Missing/Outstanding (Medium-Term: 2-4 Weeks, unless specified otherwise)
*   Performance and scalability testing (Can be Long-Term depending on depth)
*   UI testing (if applicable - assess need first)
*   Security vulnerability testing (Align with Security Design - Potentially Long-Term)
*   Comprehensive API endpoint parameter testing
*   Test data management strategy (Align with Design item - Medium Term)
*   CI/CD integration (Align with Design item - Medium Term)
*   Standardized coverage reporting (Align with Design item - Medium Term)

## 3. Knowledge Transfer Improvements

Based on `project/audit/2025-05-20 13:24-knowledge_transfer_improvements.md`. These should be implemented progressively.

### Short-Term (1-2 Weeks - Foundation)
*   **Standardized Documentation Structure:**
    *   Define and disseminate the consistent template for test documentation.
*   **Knowledge Capture Requirements:**
    *   Establish the process and tool for documenting test-related decisions.
*   **Onboarding Documentation:**
    *   Draft initial version of the onboarding guide for new testers.

### Medium-Term (2-4 Weeks - Implementation & Refinement)
*   **Knowledge Sharing Processes:**
    *   Schedule initial knowledge sharing sessions.
*   **Documentation Review:**
    *   Conduct the first quarterly review of existing test documentation against the new standard.
*   **Knowledge Base Maintenance:**
    *   Assign ownership for maintaining the test knowledge base.
*   **Onboarding Documentation:**
    *   Refine and expand the onboarding guide based on initial feedback.

### Long-Term (4+ Weeks - Continuous Improvement)
*   **Knowledge Transfer Metrics:**
    *   Define and start tracking metrics for knowledge transfer effectiveness.
*   **Cross-Team Collaboration:**
    *   Establish and document cross-team knowledge sharing protocols.
*   **Ongoing:**
    *   Regular knowledge sharing sessions.
    *   Quarterly documentation reviews.
    *   Continuous maintenance and improvement of the knowledge base and onboarding materials.

## 4. Estimated Timelines Summary

*   **Short-Term (1-2 Weeks):** Focus on critical Docker configurations, audit objectives, foundational documentation updates, completing in-progress test cases, and initiating knowledge transfer processes.
*   **Medium-Term (2-4 Weeks):** Address API versioning, MCP details, Docker hardening, implement core testing strategy enhancements (CI/CD, coverage, data management), and roll out further knowledge transfer improvements.
*   **Long-Term (4+ Weeks):** Tackle comprehensive production-readiness items including deployment topology, advanced security, scalability/performance targets, monitoring/logging, advanced LLM considerations, and mature knowledge transfer practices.

This roadmap is a living document and should be reviewed and updated periodically as the project progresses.
