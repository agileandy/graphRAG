# 3.6 Specification: MPC Server Issues

## Bug Description

The MPC (Message Passing Communication) server fails to start when using the `graphrag-service.sh` script. This prevents AI agents from connecting to the GraphRAG system via the MPC protocol.

## Requirements

1. Identify and fix the root cause of the MPC server startup failure
2. Ensure the MPC server can be started and stopped reliably
3. Implement proper error handling and logging for the MPC server

## Implementation Details

1. **Diagnostics**:
   - Add detailed logging to the MPC server startup process
   - Capture and log all exceptions during startup
   - Implement a health check endpoint for the MPC server

2. **Dependency Management**:
   - Verify all required dependencies for the MPC server are installed
   - Ensure the correct Python environment is used for the MPC server
   - Check for port conflicts or other network-related issues

3. **Service Script Updates**:
   - Update the service script to provide more detailed error messages
   - Implement proper process management for the MPC server
   - Add retry logic for transient failures

## Acceptance Criteria

1. The MPC server starts successfully using the service script
2. The MPC server can be stopped and restarted without errors
3. Detailed error messages are provided when startup fails
4. The MPC server can handle client connections reliably
5. Documentation is updated with troubleshooting information

## Notes

- For initial testing, focus on the web API endpoints instead of the MPC server
- This issue should be addressed before implementing agent integrations that rely on the MPC protocol
- Consider adding a standalone test script for the MPC server
