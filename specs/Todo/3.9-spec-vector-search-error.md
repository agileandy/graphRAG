# 3.9 Specification: Vector Search Error Fix

## Bug Description

When attempting to search the vector database using the `/search` endpoint, the following error occurs:

```
{"error":"Error executing plan: Internal error: Error creating hnsw segment reader: Nothing found on disk"}
```

This error suggests there might be an issue with the ChromaDB index files or how they're being accessed. The HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World) index, which is used for efficient similarity search, appears to be missing or corrupted.

## Requirements

1. Fix the vector search functionality to properly access the HNSW index
2. Ensure the system properly initializes and maintains the vector database indices
3. Add robust error handling for vector search operations

## Implementation Details

1. **Index Initialization**:
   - Verify that the ChromaDB collection is properly initialized with the correct settings
   - Ensure that documents are added to the collection with the proper embedding format
   - Check if the HNSW index is being created and persisted correctly

2. **Error Handling**:
   - Add try/except blocks around vector search operations
   - Implement graceful fallback when vector search fails (e.g., return graph-only results)
   - Log detailed error messages for debugging

3. **Recovery Mechanism**:
   - Add a mechanism to detect and repair corrupted indices
   - Implement a way to rebuild indices if necessary
   - Add a health check for the vector database that verifies index integrity

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Vector search operations work correctly without errors
2. The system properly initializes and maintains the HNSW index
3. The system provides clear error messages when vector search fails
4. The system can recover from index corruption or missing indices

## Notes

- This issue might be related to ChromaDB version compatibility
- Check if there are any file permission issues that might prevent index creation
- Consider adding a configuration option to control HNSW index parameters
- Document the expected format for vector search queries in the code comments
