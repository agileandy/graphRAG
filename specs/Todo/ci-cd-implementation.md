# CI/CD Implementation for GraphRAG

## Overview
This document outlines a plan for implementing a Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline for the GraphRAG project. While this is a future enhancement and not an immediate priority, it's important to document the approach for when resources become available.

## Goals
- Automate testing, linting, and code quality checks
- Ensure consistent code style and standards
- Catch issues before they reach the main repository
- Streamline the release process

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Local Development Improvements
1. Set up pre-commit hooks for:
   - Code formatting (using ruff)
   - Linting
   - Basic tests
2. Document the pre-commit setup process for all developers

### Phase 2: CI Pipeline
1. Set up GitHub Actions or similar CI service
2. Configure automated testing on pull requests
3. Implement code coverage reporting
4. Add automated dependency scanning for security vulnerabilities

### Phase 3: CD Pipeline
1. Automate Docker image building
2. Implement staging environment deployments
3. Set up automated release notes generation
4. Create versioned documentation builds

## Priority
This is a future enhancement and not an immediate priority. The focus should remain on building and improving the core GraphRAG application functionality.

## Resources Needed
- Developer time for CI/CD setup and maintenance
- Potential cloud resources for CI/CD runners
- Documentation updates for new processes

## Success Criteria
- All pull requests automatically tested before merge
- Code quality metrics tracked over time
- Reduced time spent on manual testing and deployment
- Fewer bugs reaching production

## Timeline
To be determined based on project priorities and resource availability.
