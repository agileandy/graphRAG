# 3.4 Specification: Missing Dependencies in requirements.txt

## Bug Description

The `python-dotenv` package is required by the codebase but is missing from the requirements.txt file. This causes errors when running scripts like `clean_database.py` which import the dotenv module.

## Requirements

1. Update the requirements.txt file to include all necessary dependencies
2. Ensure that `python-dotenv` is added to the requirements.txt file
3. Verify that all other required dependencies are properly listed

## Implementation Details

1. Add `python-dotenv` to requirements.txt with an appropriate version constraint
2. Review the codebase for any other missing dependencies
3. Organize requirements.txt in a logical manner (e.g., grouping core dependencies, development dependencies, etc.)

## Acceptance Criteria

1. The requirements.txt file should include `python-dotenv`
2. All scripts should run without "ModuleNotFoundError" for standard dependencies
3. A new developer should be able to set up the environment with a single `uv pip install -r requirements.txt` command

## Notes

- Consider using a tool like `pipreqs` to automatically generate requirements from imports
- Consider separating development dependencies into a requirements-dev.txt file
- Ensure compatibility with the UV package manager
