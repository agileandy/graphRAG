# Bug Report: NLP Processing Test Error

## Description
Test 4 (NLP Processing) is failing with the error "name 'expected' is not defined". This appears to be a reference to an undefined variable in the test script.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Run the regression tests with `python -m tests.regression.run_all_tests`
2. Observe that Test 4 fails with the error "name 'expected' is not defined"

## Expected Behavior
Test 4 should pass, verifying that NLP processing works correctly.

## Actual Behavior
The test fails with a NameError: "name 'expected' is not defined".

## Fix Required
Examine the `test_04_nlp_processing.py` file to find and fix the reference to the undefined variable `expected`. This could be a typo or a missing variable definition.

## Additional Notes
- This is a simple coding error in the test script, not a functional issue with the GraphRAG system
- The test appears to be correctly verifying that NLP concepts are in the database, but then fails when trying to check something else
