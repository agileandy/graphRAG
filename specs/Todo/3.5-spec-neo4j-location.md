# 3.5 Specification: Neo4j and Dependencies Location

## Bug Description

Currently, Neo4j is installed in the project directory rather than in the hidden `.graphrag` folder, which should be the permanent location for runtime artifacts. Similarly, gunicorn and other runtime dependencies should be properly installed and accessible from the service scripts.

## Requirements

1. Move Neo4j installation to the `.graphrag` folder
2. Ensure gunicorn and other dependencies are properly installed and accessible
3. Update all service scripts to use the correct paths

## Implementation Details

1. **Neo4j Installation**:
   - Update the installation script to install Neo4j in `$HOME/.graphrag/neo4j`
   - Ensure all configuration files are properly set up in this location
   - Update all scripts that reference Neo4j to use this location

2. **Dependency Management**:
   - Ensure gunicorn is installed in the virtual environment
   - Update service scripts to use the virtual environment's gunicorn
   - Consider creating a wrapper script that sets up the correct environment

3. **Configuration Updates**:
   - Update the `.env` and `config.env` files to reflect the new locations
   - Ensure Docker configurations are consistent with local configurations
   - Document the changes in the project documentation

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Neo4j is installed and runs from `$HOME/.graphrag/neo4j`
2. All service scripts can start and stop Neo4j without errors
3. Gunicorn and other dependencies are properly installed and accessible
4. Docker configurations are consistent with local configurations
5. Documentation is updated to reflect the changes

## Notes

- This change will require users to reinstall Neo4j in the new location
- Consider providing a migration script to help users move their existing data
- Ensure backward compatibility for users who have customized their setup
