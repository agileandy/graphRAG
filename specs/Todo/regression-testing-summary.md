# GraphRAG Regression Testing Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the results of running the GraphRAG regression test suite. The tests were run on the `task-regression-testing` branch.

## Test Results
All tests are currently failing due to various issues. The main issues are:

1. The vector database (ChromaDB) is not connecting properly, causing the API to report a degraded status and all document-related operations to fail with a 500 error.
2. The services are not stopping properly when the `stop_services` function is called in the regression tests.
3. The `/documents` API endpoint is not returning the document ID in the response.
4. The NLP Processing test is failing with the error "name 'expected' is not defined".

## Issues Fixed
The following issues were fixed during the regression testing:

1. **Bug #1: GraphRAG Service Script Python Path Issue**
   - The `graphrag-service.sh` script was using the system's default `python` and `gunicorn` commands instead of the ones from the virtual environment.
   - Fixed by updating the script to use the Python interpreter and gunicorn from the virtual environment.

2. **Bug #2: Port Configuration Mismatch**
   - There was a mismatch between the port configured in the `.graphrag/config.env` file (5000) and the port expected by the test suite (5001).
   - Fixed by updating the config file to use port 5001.

3. **Bug #3: Neo4j Path Configuration**
   - The GraphRAG service script was configured to use Neo4j from `~/.graphrag/neo4j`, but Neo4j is actually installed via Homebrew at `/opt/homebrew/bin/neo4j`.
   - Fixed by updating the config file to use the correct Neo4j home directory.

4. **Bug #7: Document ID Not Returned in API Response**
   - The `/documents` API endpoint was returning `doc_id` instead of `document_id` in the response.
   - Fixed by updating the `add_document_to_graphrag` function to return `document_id` instead of `doc_id`.

## Issues Reported
The following issues were reported but not fixed:

1. **Bug #4: Vector Database Connection Issue (CRITICAL)**
   - The vector database (ChromaDB) is not connecting properly, causing the API to report a degraded status and all document-related operations to fail with a 500 error.
   - This is a critical issue that prevents all document-related functionality from working.
   - A comprehensive analysis and resolution path has been documented in `4-bug-vector-db-connection.md`.

2. **Bug #5: Add Document API Endpoint**
   - The `/documents` API endpoint is failing with a 500 error because the `add_document_to_graphrag` function signature in the API server doesn't match the actual function in the `scripts/add_document.py` file.
   - The function in the script requires a `duplicate_detector` parameter, but the API server isn't providing it.

3. **Bug #6: Services Not Stopping Properly**
   - The GraphRAG services are not stopping properly when the `stop_services` function is called in the regression tests.
   - This causes Test 1 to fail at the "Verifying services are stopped" step.

4. **Bug #8: NLP Processing Test Error**
   - Test 4 (NLP Processing) is failing with the error "name 'expected' is not defined".
   - This appears to be a reference to an undefined variable in the test script.

5. **Bug #9: ChromaDB Directory Mismatch**
   - There is a mismatch between the ChromaDB directory specified in the environment variable and the directory used by the code.
   - The environment variable `CHROMA_PERSIST_DIRECTORY` is set to `/Users/andyspamer/.graphrag/data/chromadb` in the config file, but the code is using a default value of `./data/chromadb` when the environment variable is not found.

## Next Steps
To make the regression tests pass, the following steps need to be taken:

1. Fix Bug #4 (Vector Database Connection Issue) to ensure the vector database connects properly.
2. Fix Bug #6 (Services Not Stopping Properly) to ensure Test 1 passes.
3. Fix Bug #8 (NLP Processing Test Error) to ensure Test 4 passes.
4. Run the regression tests again to verify that all tests pass.

## Conclusion
The GraphRAG system has several issues that need to be fixed before the regression tests can pass. The most critical issue is the vector database connection (Bug #4), which is preventing all document-related operations from working. Once this issue is fixed, the other issues can be addressed one by one.
