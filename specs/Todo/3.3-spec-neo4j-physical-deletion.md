# 3.3 Specification: Neo4j Physical Deletion Option

## Bug Description

The current `clean_database.py` script only empties the Neo4j database by running the Cypher query `MATCH (n) DETACH DELETE n`, but it does not physically delete the Neo4j database files. In contrast, the ChromaDB portion of the script physically deletes and recreates the data directory.

## Requirements

1. Add an option to `clean_database.py` to physically delete the Neo4j database files
2. Implement a function that:
   - Stops the Neo4j server if it's running
   - Physically deletes the Neo4j data directory
   - Recreates the necessary directory structure
   - Optionally restarts Neo4j with a clean database

## Implementation Details

1. Add a new command-line argument `--physical-delete` to `clean_database.py`
2. Create a new function `physically_delete_neo4j()` that:
   - Determines the Neo4j data directory from environment variables
   - Stops the Neo4j server using the appropriate command
   - Deletes the data directory using `shutil.rmtree()`
   - Recreates the necessary directory structure
   - Optionally restarts Neo4j

## Acceptance Criteria

1. The `--physical-delete` option should be available in `clean_database.py`
2. When used, it should completely remove all Neo4j data files
3. After deletion, Neo4j should be able to start with a clean database
4. The script should handle errors gracefully and provide clear error messages
5. Documentation should be updated to reflect the new option

## Notes

- This is a destructive operation and should require explicit confirmation
- Consider adding a backup option before deletion
- Ensure compatibility with both local and Docker deployments
