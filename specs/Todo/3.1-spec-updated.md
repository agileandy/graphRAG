# Specification: Improve Document Processing (Phase 3.1)

## Overview

This specification outlines the improvements needed for document processing in the GraphRAG system, focusing on fixing ChromaDB issues, enhancing deduplication, and expanding concept extraction capabilities.

## 1. Fix ChromaDB Issues

### Problem Statement

The current implementation encounters errors when processing large books, specifically "Error in compaction: Failed to apply logs to the metadata segment". Only 8 out of 11 books from the Industry5 folder were successfully processed.

**Hypothesis:** This error likely stems from issues with ChromaDB's internal data handling during large-scale insertions or potentially a version incompatibility. The way documents are chunked and added might also contribute.

**Necessary Fixes:** The requirements outlined in this section (ChromaDB Version Update, Error Handling Improvements, Retry Logic, and Chunk Size Optimization) are designed to address this problem by improving ChromaDB stability, handling transient errors, and optimizing data insertion.

### Requirements

1. **ChromaDB Version Update**
   - Update ChromaDB to the latest stable version
   - Test compatibility with existing data
   - Document migration process if needed

2. **Error Handling Improvements**
   - Implement robust error handling for ChromaDB operations
   - Add detailed logging for ChromaDB errors
   - Create recovery mechanisms for failed operations

3. **Retry Logic**
   - Implement exponential backoff retry for failed document additions
   - Set configurable retry limits and delays
   - Log retry attempts and outcomes

4. **Chunk Size Optimization**
   - Implement adaptive chunk sizing based on document characteristics
   - Add configuration options for chunk size parameters
   - Benchmark different chunk sizes for performance and reliability
