Summary of Changes
We have successfully implemented the changes requested in next-steps-1.md:

Updated the Docker Entrypoint Script:
Added a new verify_neo4j_connection function to properly test Neo4j connectivity
Improved the Neo4j password reset process with better error handling and multiple methods
Enhanced the MPC server startup with proper environment variables and dependency checks
Added better diagnostics and logging for the MPC server
Updated the system information section to show correct port mappings and real-time status
Updated the Documentation:
Added detailed information about Neo4j password reset procedures
Added a comprehensive section on Docker port mapping issues
Added a new section on testing with Claude
Included more troubleshooting steps for common issues
Testing with Claude:
Added documentation on how to test the MPC server with Claude
Included example prompts for testing search and add-document functionality
Added troubleshooting steps for common Claude integration issues
Next Steps
To complete the implementation, the following steps should be taken:

Test the changes:
Build and run the Docker container with the updated entrypoint script
Verify that Neo4j password reset works correctly
Test the MPC server connectivity
Test with Claude to ensure it can connect and use the tools
Further improvements:
Consider adding automated tests for the MPC server
Improve error handling in the MPC server implementation
Add more detailed logging for troubleshooting
These changes should ensure that the GraphRAG MPC Server integration works correctly in the future, addressing the issues with Neo4j password reset, port mapping, and MPC server connectivity.
