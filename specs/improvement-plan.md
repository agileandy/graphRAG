## Implementation Notes

### Organic Growth of Concepts and Topics

The GraphRAG system is designed to handle a wide range of domains including:
- AI and Machine Learning
- Programming (Python, Shell, Apple, etc.)
- Photography
- Finance
- Health
- Law
- Microsoft Office (Excel, VBA, PowerPoint)
- Networking
- Computer Security
- Agile Coaching and Business Transformation
- Management and Leadership
- Psychology & Emotional Intelligence
- And many other topics

The concept extraction and relationship building mechanisms should be designed to accommodate organic growth as new books are added and analyzed. The system should not be limited to predefined concepts but should be able to discover and integrate new concepts automatically.

### Self-Contained Docker Container

The Docker container must be entirely self-contained with everything needed to run the GraphRAG system. This includes:
- Neo4j database
- Vector database (ChromaDB)
- All required Python dependencies
- API and MPC servers
- Proper initialization and configuration scripts
- Data persistence mechanisms

No external services or dependencies should be required to run the system, making it easy to deploy and use in various environments.
