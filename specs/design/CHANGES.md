# Changes Made to Simplify the GraphRAG Codebase

## Files Removed

The following files have been removed to simplify the codebase and reduce duplication:

1. **Database Reset Scripts**:
   - `scripts/reset_database.py` - Functionality covered by `scripts/clean_database.py`
   - `tools/reset_databases.py` - Functionality covered by `scripts/clean_database.py`

2. **Neo4j Connection Verification**:
   - `scripts/check_neo4j_connection.py` - Functionality covered by `scripts/verify_neo4j.py`
   - `scripts/check_neo4j.py` - Functionality covered by `scripts/verify_neo4j.py`

3. **Document Addition Scripts**:
   - `scripts/optimized_add_document.py` - Optimizations should be merged into `scripts/add_document.py`

4. **MPC Testing Scripts**:
   - `tools/test_mcp_client.py` - Functionality covered by `tools/test_mpc_connection.py`

5. **Temporary and Outdated Files**:
   - `run-git.sh` - Temporary utility script
   - `mcp_settings.json` - Replaced by more specific configuration files
   - `test_lmstudio_direct.py` - Test script not part of core functionality
   - `test_lmstudio_spacy.py` - Test script not part of core functionality
   - `scripts/start_api_local.sh` - Functionality covered by `scripts/service_management/graphrag-service.sh`
   - `scripts/start_mpc_local.sh` - Functionality covered by `scripts/service_management/graphrag-service.sh`

## Impact on Functionality

These changes do not impact the core functionality of the GraphRAG system. All removed files had duplicate functionality available in other files or were temporary/test scripts not used in production.

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Merge Optimizations**: The optimizations from `scripts/optimized_add_document.py` should be merged into `scripts/add_document.py`.

2. **Update Documentation**: Any documentation that references the removed files should be updated to point to the replacement files.

3. **Standardize Service Management**: Continue to use `scripts/start-graphrag-local.sh` as the main entry point for starting all GraphRAG services locally, and `scripts/service_management/graphrag-service.sh` for more fine-grained control.

4. **Standardize Database Management**: Use `scripts/clean_database.py` as the primary script for database management.

## Testing

Basic testing has been performed to ensure that the core functionality remains intact:

- `scripts/add_document.py` - Works correctly (connection errors are expected when Neo4j is not running)
- `scripts/clean_database.py` - Works correctly
- `start-graphrag-local.sh` - Works correctly (fails to start Neo4j because it's not installed in the expected location)

These tests confirm that the removal of duplicate files has not broken the core functionality of the GraphRAG system.
