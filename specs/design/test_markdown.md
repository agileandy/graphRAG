# GraphRAG: A Hybrid Approach to RAG Systems

## Introduction

GraphRAG is a hybrid approach to Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems that combines the power of knowledge graphs with vector databases. This approach provides several advantages over traditional RAG systems:

1. **Improved Context Retrieval**: By using a knowledge graph, GraphRAG can retrieve related concepts and their relationships, providing richer context for generation.

2. **Better Handling of Complex Queries**: The graph structure allows for more complex query patterns that are difficult to express in vector space alone.

3. **Enhanced Explainability**: The graph structure makes it easier to trace how information was retrieved and why certain contexts were included.

## System Architecture

The GraphRAG system consists of the following components:

- **Neo4j Database**: Stores the knowledge graph with concepts and their relationships
- **Vector Database**: Stores text embeddings for efficient similarity search
- **Document Processors**: Handle various document formats including:
  - Text files
  - JSON files
  - Markdown files
  - PDF documents (with advanced processing for tables and diagrams)

## Implementation Details

The system is implemented in Python and uses the following technologies:

```python
# Example code for processing a document
def process_document(file_path):
    # Extract text and metadata
    text, metadata = extract_content(file_path)
    
    # Create embeddings
    embeddings = create_embeddings(text)
    
    # Store in vector database
    vector_db.add(embeddings, metadata)
    
    # Extract concepts and relationships
    concepts = extract_concepts(text)
    
    # Store in knowledge graph
    graph_db.add_concepts(concepts)
```

## Conclusion

GraphRAG represents a significant advancement in RAG systems by combining the strengths of knowledge graphs and vector databases. This hybrid approach enables more sophisticated information retrieval and better context for generation tasks.
