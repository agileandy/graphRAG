# Product Requirements Document: GraphRAG

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** {{YYYY-MM-DD}} (Current Date)
**Author:** AI Assistant (based on design.md)

## 1. Introduction

GraphRAG is an advanced information retrieval and generation system designed to enhance Large Language Models (LLMs) by leveraging the power of knowledge graphs alongside traditional vector-based retrieval. It addresses the limitations of standard Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, which primarily rely on semantic similarity and may miss nuanced relationships and contextual understanding inherent in structured knowledge. By integrating graph databases (e.g., Neo4j) with vector databases (e.g., ChromaDB), GraphRAG aims to provide more accurate, context-aware, and comprehensive responses.

## 2. Goals and Objectives

*   **Improve Answer Quality:** Enhance the relevance, accuracy, and depth of information retrieved and generated by LLMs.
*   **Enable Deeper Understanding:** Allow the system to understand and utilize explicit relationships between entities and concepts within a corpus of documents.
*   **Facilitate Complex Queries:** Support queries that require reasoning over interconnected information, not just keyword or semantic matching.
*   **Scalable Knowledge Management:** Provide a robust framework for ingesting, processing, storing, and querying large volumes of documents and the knowledge extracted from them.
*   **Modular and Extensible Architecture:** Design a system that can be easily extended with new data loaders, processing modules, and query capabilities.

## 3. Target Users

*   **Researchers & Analysts:** Individuals who need to synthesize information from large, complex datasets and uncover hidden connections.
*   **Developers & AI Engineers:** Teams building sophisticated AI applications that require deep contextual understanding and knowledge-driven responses (e.g., advanced Q&A systems, intelligent assistants).
*   **Knowledge Managers:** Professionals responsible for organizing and making accessible large bodies of enterprise knowledge.

## 4. User Stories / Key Scenarios

*   **As a researcher,** I want to ingest a collection of academic papers, so that I can ask complex questions about the relationships between different research findings and concepts.
*   **As a developer,** I want to integrate GraphRAG into my customer support chatbot, so that it can provide more accurate and comprehensive answers by understanding the relationships between products, issues, and solutions.
*   **As an analyst,** I want to upload a set of industry reports, so that I can explore the connections between companies, technologies, and market trends.
*   **As a user,** I want to receive answers that not only provide direct information but also explain the context and relationships supporting the answer.
*   **As an administrator,** I want to easily manage and monitor the data ingestion process and the health of the underlying databases.

## 5. Core Features (High-Level)

*   **F1: Document Ingestion & Processing:**
    *   Support for various document formats (e.g., PDF, Markdown, text).
    *   Automated text extraction and chunking.
    *   Metadata extraction and preservation.
*   **F2: Knowledge Graph Construction:**
    *   Entity extraction (e.g., concepts, people, organizations).
    *   Relationship extraction between entities.
    *   Storage of entities and relationships in a graph database (Neo4j).
    *   Deduplication of concepts and entities.
*   **F3: Vector Embeddings:**
    *   Generation of vector embeddings for text chunks.
    *   Storage and indexing of embeddings in a vector database (ChromaDB).
*   **F4: Hybrid Search & Retrieval:**
    *   Semantic search using vector similarity.
    *   Graph-based traversal and pattern matching for relationship-aware retrieval.
    *   Combination of semantic and graph search results to provide rich context.
*   **F5: Query Interface:**
    *   API endpoint for submitting natural language queries.
    *   (Potentially) Message Passing Communication (MCP) server for tool-based interaction.
*   **F6: Response Generation:**
    *   Integration with LLMs to synthesize retrieved context into coherent answers.
*   **F7: Database Management & Linkage:**
    *   Mechanisms for linking information between the graph and vector databases.
    *   Tools for database reset, verification, and maintenance.
*   **F8: Duplicate Detection:**
    *   System to identify and handle duplicate documents or content during ingestion.

## 6. Success Metrics (High-Level)

*   **Answer Relevance & Accuracy:** Measured by user feedback, automated evaluations (e.g., RAGAs), or comparison against human-generated answers.
*   **Query Completion Rate:** Percentage of user queries successfully answered.
*   **System Performance:** Latency for document ingestion and query processing.
*   **Knowledge Graph Richness:** Number of entities and relationships extracted per document; complexity of the graph.
*   **User Adoption & Satisfaction:** Number of active users, frequency of use, qualitative feedback.

## 7. Non-Functional Requirements (High-Level)

*   **Scalability:** Ability to handle a growing number of documents and concurrent users.
*   **Reliability:** Consistent uptime and robust error handling.
*   **Maintainability:** Well-documented code, modular design for ease of updates and bug fixes.
*   **Security:** (If applicable) Secure handling of data, especially if processing sensitive information.

## 8. Future Considerations / Potential Enhancements

*   Advanced graph analytics and visualization tools.
*   Support for a wider range of document types and data sources (e.g., web pages, databases).
*   User interface for interactive graph exploration and query building.
*   Enhanced explainability of query results, showing provenance from source documents and graph paths.
*   Multi-lingual support.
*   Fine-tuning of LLMs based on domain-specific knowledge graphs.
