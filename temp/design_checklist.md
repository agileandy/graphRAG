# GraphRAG Design Completion Checklist and Summary

## Design Summary

### 1. Completed Design Elements

*   **Core System Architecture:**
    *   Objectives and Principles defined.
    *   High-level approach (Document Processing, Hybrid Retrieval, System Architecture layers - Database, Processing, API, MCP) established.
    *   Database choices (Neo4j for graph, ChromaDB for vector) made.
    *   Concept extraction and relationship identification outlined.
*   **Configuration Management:**
    *   Centralized port configuration system using `src/config/ports.py` and environment variables.
    *   Key configuration files identified (`.env`, `config/env.docker`, `src/config/ports.py`, `docker-compose.yml`, `$HOME/.graphrag/config.env`).
    *   Methods for accessing configuration in Python and shell scripts.
*   **Networking:**
    *   Default port assignments for services (API, MPC, MCP, Neo4j, etc.) documented.
    *   Docker port mappings specified.
    *   Inter-service communication protocols (Bolt, HTTP, WebSocket) defined.
*   **Deployment:**
    *   Local deployment guide for macOS (without Docker) detailed, including prerequisites, installation, configuration, running services, verification, and troubleshooting.
    *   Initial Neo4j and ChromaDB setup and optimization parameters documented.
*   **Database Design & Optimization:**
    *   Neo4j schema (referencing Book, Chapter, Section, Concept) outlined.
    *   Neo4j memory configuration and indexing strategies defined.
    *   ChromaDB collection structure and HNSW index configuration specified.
    *   Smart chunking strategy and batch processing for ChromaDB.
*   **MCP (Mode Control Protocol) Design:**
    *   Purpose of MCP server for AI assistant interaction defined.
*   **Dockerization (Initial Stages):**
    *   Development workflow with volume mounts (recommended) and development inside container options.
    *   Synchronization of Python packages and configuration changes between host and container.
    *   Basic Docker Compose setup for development (`docker-compose.dev.yml`) and production (`docker-compose.prod.yml`) outlined.
    *   Dockerfile best practices (multi-stage builds, layer optimization, non-root user) introduced.
    *   Port configuration within Docker context discussed.
*   **Testing Strategy (Initial Framework):**
    *   Overall test strategy principles (coverage, automation, early feedback, maintainability, consistency).
    *   Use of `pytest` as the primary test runner.
    *   Categorization of tests (unit, integration, E2E) with examples.
    *   Test automation tools and scripts identified (e.g., `uv run pytest`, utility scripts in `scripts/`).
    *   Basic test data management practices (e.g., `tests/regression/data/`, example documents).
*   **Audit Framework:**
    *   Comprehensive checklists for Code Quality, Security, Performance, and Architecture.
    *   Risk assessment criteria (severity levels, impact vs. likelihood matrix).
    *   Evidence collection procedures and reporting standards.
    *   Automation integration (SAST, test coverage, performance metrics).
    *   Git management audit checklist (commit messages, branching, linting, releases, `.gitignore`).
    *   Package management audit checklist (tool compliance, dependency files, update processes).

### 2. In-Progress Design Elements

*   **Docker Configuration Refinement:**
    *   The `graphRAG-docker.md` has a "TODO: Add content for Docker Configuration" at the top, suggesting the overall Docker strategy might still be evolving or needs consolidation.
    *   Detailed production hardening for Docker images and orchestration (beyond basic compose files) seems to be an ongoing effort.
    *   Full resolution of all "Known Port Inconsistencies and Issues" mentioned in `graphRAG-design.md` and `graphRAG-docker.md` (e.g., MPC/MCP port discrepancies across different files/docs). While a centralized system is in place, ensuring all components *use* it correctly is ongoing.
*   **Test Strategy Implementation & Enhancement:**
    *   Formalized CI/CD integration for automated test execution.
    *   Implementation and regular review of test coverage reports.
    *   Standardized test environment setup, explicitly leveraging Docker.
    *   Clearer strategy for test data management and versioning (recommendations from `Test_Plan.md` are noted as needing action).
*   **Audit Objectives Definition:**
    *   `graphRAG-audit.md` has "TODO: Add content for Audit Objectives".
*   **Documentation Updates:**
    *   Ongoing need to update documentation to reflect changes, especially regarding removed/consolidated scripts (as noted in `graphRAG-audit.md` recommendations).

### 3. Missing/Outstanding Design Requirements

*   **Formalized Production Deployment Topology:**
    *   While local and basic Docker deployments are covered, a detailed design for a robust, scalable production deployment (e.g., using Kubernetes, specific cloud provider services, advanced networking, monitoring, logging beyond basic file logs) is not explicitly detailed in these documents. `graphRAG-design.md` mentions "(Note: For Docker deployment and Production Deployment Topology, refer to the main `design.md` document.)" but the provided `graphRAG-design.md` itself doesn't fully elaborate on a complex production topology.
*   **Advanced Security Design:**
    *   While the audit checklist covers security principles, a dedicated security design document detailing threat models, specific security measures for each component in production, data encryption key management in a production setting, and incident response plans seems absent.
*   **Scalability and Performance Benchmarking & Targets:**
    *   General strategies for scaling (e.g., sharding ChromaDB, Neo4j indexing) are mentioned, but specific performance benchmarks, load testing plans, and defined performance targets (SLAs/SLOs) for production are not detailed.
*   **Detailed Monitoring and Logging Strategy for Production:**
    *   While Prometheus and Grafana are mentioned as default ports, a comprehensive design for what metrics to collect, how to aggregate logs in a distributed environment, and alerting strategies for production is not fully laid out.
*   **Data Lifecycle Management:**
    *   Policies for data retention, archival, and deletion, especially for large volumes of documents and graph data in a production environment.
*   **User Management and Access Control (Beyond Neo4j Auth):**
    *   If the API or other system interfaces require user authentication and authorization, the design for this is not detailed.
*   **Disaster Recovery and Business Continuity Plan:**
    *   Strategies for backing up and restoring Neo4j and ChromaDB in a production scenario, and overall system recovery plans.
*   **API Versioning Strategy:**
    *   How API changes will be managed to ensure backward compatibility or smooth transitions for clients.
*   **LLM Interaction - Advanced Considerations:**
    *   While concept extraction prompts are shown, deeper design considerations for LLM fine-tuning, managing different LLM providers/models, cost optimization for LLM calls at scale, and handling LLM rate limits or failures in production are not extensively covered.
